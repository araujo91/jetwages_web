# Privacy & Data Policy – JetWages  
_Last updated: 19 November 2025_

JetWages is an independent project operated by **João Araújo** in the United Kingdom.  
This policy explains how JetWages handles your data in compliance with UK and EU data protection laws (UK GDPR / EU GDPR).

---

## 1. Overview  
JetWages helps flight crew understand and track their pay accurately. Your data privacy and security are core design principles.
In addition to the app itself, JetWages may use optional forms to collect voluntary information that helps improve accuracy.
---

## 2. Data Controller  
**Controller:** João Araújo  
**Email:** [joao@jetwages.com](mailto:joao@jetwages.com)  
**Location:** United Kingdom  

---

## 3. Local-First Model  
JetWages follows a **local-first and ephemeral-processing** model:

- All data (including payslips, rosters, and pay breakdowns) is processed locally on your device.  
- Uploaded files are **temporarily sent via HTTPS** to a secure UK-based server for parsing, then **deleted immediately after processing**.  
- No uploaded files, parsed content, or logs are retained or stored after completion.

In addition, some optional forms (such as wage component forms, setup research, or feedback forms) are hosted using Google tools.
These form responses are stored in Google Sheets under our Google Workspace account and are not linked to your in-app data.
---

## 4. File Processing  
When you upload a payslip or supplementary file, JetWages extracts pay information and returns it to your device.  
The original file is **automatically deleted within seconds** of parsing — ensuring nothing is stored on the server.

---

## 5. Data Retention  
- JetWages does **not** store any uploaded files or parsed data externally.  
- All pay and schedule data remain stored locally on your device.  
- Deleting or uninstalling the app removes all stored data.  
- JetWages does **not** use analytics, cookies, or third-party tracking.
- Form responses (including any wage component information and, where provided, your email address) are stored in Google Sheets and retained only for testing, support, or improving JetWages — or until you ask for deletion.

---

## 6. Email Communications  
If you voluntarily provide your email (e.g., for beta access, feedback, or updates), it is stored securely and used **only** for JetWages-related communication.  
Some forms explicitly ask whether you consent to being contacted.
Your email is only collected if you answer “Yes” or otherwise clearly consent.
You can unsubscribe at any time, and your email will be deleted upon request or at the end of the beta phase.

---

## 7. Legal Basis for Processing  
The lawful basis for processing your data (such as uploaded files and email contact) is your **consent**.  
You may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting [joao@jetwages.com](mailto:jetwages@gmail.com).

---

## 8. Security Measures  
- All uploads use **HTTPS encryption**.  
- Uploaded files are deleted immediately after parsing.  
- Local app data is stored using secure OS-level storage (AsyncStorage).  
- Form responses in Google Sheets are securely protected by Google’s infrastructure and accessible only to authorised personnel.
- JetWages includes **no tracking or third-party analytics**.

---

## 9. Your Rights  
Under UK and EU GDPR, you have the right to:  
- Access any personal data we may hold (e.g., your email, if provided)  
- Request correction or deletion of your contact data  
- Withdraw consent at any time  
- Request deletion of any form responses stored in Google Sheets
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority
