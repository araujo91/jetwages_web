_Last updated: 18 October 2025_

## 1. Overview  
JetWages helps flight crew understand and track their pay accurately. Your data privacy and security are core design principles.

## 2. Data Controller  
**Controller:** JoÃ£o AraÃºjo  
**Email:** [jetwages@gmail.com](mailto:jetwages@gmail.com)  
**Location:** United Kingdom  

---

## 3. Local-First Model  
JetWages follows a **local-first and ephemeral-processing** model:

- All data (including payslips, rosters, and pay breakdowns) is processed locally on your device.  
- Uploaded files are **temporarily sent via HTTPS** to a secure UK-based server for parsing, then **deleted immediately after processing**.  
- No uploaded files, parsed content, or logs are retained or stored after completion.

---

## 4. File Processing  
When you upload a payslip or supplementary file, JetWages extracts pay information and returns it to your device.  
The original file is **automatically deleted within seconds** of parsing â€” ensuring nothing is stored on the server.

---

## 5. Data Retention  
- JetWages does **not** store any uploaded files or parsed data externally.  
- All pay and schedule data remain stored locally on your device.  
- Deleting or uninstalling the app removes all stored data.  
- JetWages does **not** use analytics, cookies, or third-party tracking.

---

## 6. Email Communications  
If you voluntarily provide your email (e.g., for beta access, feedback, or updates), it is stored securely and used **only** for JetWages-related communication.  
You can unsubscribe at any time, and your email will be deleted upon request or at the end of the beta phase.

## 7. Legal Basis for Processing  
The lawful basis for processing your data (such as uploaded files and email contact) is your **consent**.  
You may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting [jetwages@gmail.com](mailto:jetwages@gmail.com).

## 8. Security Measures  
- All uploads use **HTTPS encryption**.  
- Uploaded files are deleted immediately after parsing.  
- Local app data is stored using secure OS-level storage (AsyncStorage).  
- JetWages includes **no tracking or third-party analytics**.
