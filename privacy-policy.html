    <h1>Privacy & Data Policy – JetWages</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 19 November 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>JetWages is an independent project operated in the United Kingdom. This policy explains how JetWages handles your data in compliance with UK and EU data protection laws (UK GDPR / EU GDPR).</p>

    <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a><br>
      <strong>Location:</strong> United Kingdom
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local-First Model</h2>
    <p>JetWages follows a <strong>local-first and ephemeral-processing</strong> model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data (including payslips, rosters, and pay breakdowns) is processed locally on your device.</li>
      <li>Files uploaded for parsing are temporarily sent via HTTPS to a secure UK-based server and <strong>deleted immediately after successful parsing</strong>.</li>
      <li>No files, parsed data, or logs are retained on the server after the process completes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Separate from the app itself, some optional forms (for example, forms used to understand wage components or for setup research) are hosted using Google tools. These responses are stored in <strong>Google Sheets</strong> under our Google Workspace account and are not linked to your in-app data.</p>

    <h2>4. File Processing</h2>
    <p>When you upload a payslip or supplementary file, JetWages processes it securely to extract pay data. The file is automatically deleted as soon as parsing finishes — usually within seconds — ensuring that no copy remains stored anywhere on the server.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No uploaded files or parsed content are stored on JetWages servers.</li>
      <li>All pay and schedule data remain on your device and are deleted if you uninstall the app.</li>
      <li>Form responses (including any wage component details and, where provided, your email address) stored in Google Sheets are kept only for as long as needed for testing, support, or improving JetWages, or until you ask us to delete them.</li>
      <li>No analytics, cookies, or external databases track user activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Email Communications</h2>
    <p>If you voluntarily provide your email (for example, for beta access, feedback, updates, or as part of a wage component/setup form), it is stored securely and used only for communication about JetWages.</p>
    <p>Some forms may ask whether you agree to be contacted. In those cases, your email is only collected and stored if you select “Yes” or otherwise clearly consent to being contacted.</p>
    <p>You can unsubscribe at any time, and your email (and any associated form responses) will be deleted upon request or at the end of the relevant testing or feedback phase.</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>The lawful basis for processing your data (for example, uploaded files, contact email, and any wage component information you submit through forms) is your <strong>consent</strong>. You may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting <a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>All transfers use HTTPS encryption. Uploaded files are deleted immediately after parsing. Local app data is stored using secure device-level storage. JetWages does not use tracking or third-party analytics. Form responses stored in Google Sheets are protected by Google’s security measures and restricted to authorised access only.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the limited data we hold (for example, your email and any form responses, if provided)</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your contact data and form responses</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
      <li>Lodge a complaint with your data protection authority</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions or privacy concerns, contact:<br>
      <strong><a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a></strong>
    </p>

    <h2>11. Complaints</h2>
    <p>You may contact your local data authority. In the UK, this is the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a>.</p>
