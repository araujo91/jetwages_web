    <h1>Privacy & Data Policy – JetWages</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 18 October 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>JetWages is an independent project operated in the United Kingdom. This policy explains how JetWages handles your data in compliance with UK and EU data protection laws (UK GDPR / EU GDPR).</p>

    <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a><br>
      <strong>Location:</strong> United Kingdom
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local-First Model</h2>
    <p>JetWages follows a <strong>local-first and ephemeral-processing</strong> model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data (including payslips, rosters, and pay breakdowns) is processed locally on your device.</li>
      <li>Files uploaded for parsing are temporarily sent via HTTPS to a secure UK-based server and <strong>deleted immediately after successful parsing</strong>.</li>
      <li>No files, parsed data, or logs are retained on the server after the process completes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. File Processing</h2>
    <p>When you upload a payslip or supplementary file, JetWages processes it securely to extract pay data. The file is automatically deleted as soon as parsing finishes — usually within seconds — ensuring that no copy remains stored anywhere on the server.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No uploaded files or parsed content are stored on JetWages servers.</li>
      <li>All pay and schedule data remain on your device and are deleted if you uninstall the app.</li>
      <li>No analytics, cookies, or external databases track user activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Email Communications</h2>
    <p>If you voluntarily provide your email (e.g., for beta access, feedback, or updates), it’s stored securely and used only for communication about JetWages. You can unsubscribe anytime, and your email will be deleted upon request or at the end of the beta phase.</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>The lawful basis for processing your data (e.g., uploaded files and email contact) is your <strong>consent</strong>. You may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting <a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>All transfers use HTTPS encryption. Uploaded files are deleted immediately after parsing. Local app data is stored using secure device-level storage. JetWages does not use tracking or third-party analytics.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the limited data we hold (e.g., email, if provided)</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your contact data</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
      <li>Lodge a complaint with your data protection authority</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions or privacy concerns, contact:<br>
      <strong><a data-const="email">data@jetwages.com</a></strong>
    </p>

    <h2>11. Complaints</h2>
    <p>You may contact your local data authority. In the UK, this is the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a>.</p>
